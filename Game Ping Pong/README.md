## How to play?
Well, acctualy there're 2 playing modes for the game in this project (you might guess): "2 players mode" and "play with computer (or 1 player mode)".
Your job is just to download the project to your computer, and build it using VS2017. But it might be uncompatible with your version of Visual Studio (you might use VS2015, VS2019 or even VS2017 with other SDK version,...)
Don't worry, just retarget it to your SDK and Toolset version. Google search "retarget project in Visual Studio" if you're getting stuck, it's quite easy so don't be sweat out.

After build and run the project. You'll see a window like this:

**Press Enter to start**

### 1 player mode
As I said above. There're 1 player mode and 2 players mode. And **1 player mode** is being default. You might notice there's a red number 1 in the top left corner.
It indicates that you're in 1 player mode bro. And the red rectangle (or you could call it *__paddle__*) belongs to the computer. You could only control the white one on the right.
"How do I control it?". Guess. You guessed it right. Use your **Up Arrow Key** if you want your white paddle to move up, and **Down Arrow Key** to move your paddle down.
But don't move blindly please, move it to beat the bot okey?

### 2 players mode
Play with computer is fun, I know. But it's lonely. You shouldn't play anything alone. Invite your friend, I mean your very best friend to play with, and beat him.
Now I assume that you invited your friend to sit beside you. Now you would press the **Ctrl Key** to switch to **2 players mode**. 
You'll notice that the red number 1 now change to 2 and you know that it's in 2 players mode. The right paddle is controlled the same way (Up and Down), and for you. The left one's controlled by 'W' and 'S' and for your friend.
Now I know you're playing happily, everyone is happy. Keep enjoying it!!

**2 Player Mode**

####For recap:
Enter to start game
Ctrl to swith mode
'W' and 'S' to move left paddle, Up and Down to move right paddle
